🍅Welcome to the **Tomato Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) Pipelines Repository**🍅  
This repository hosts a comprehensive collection of scripts and resources developed for the construction and analysis of **organ-specific GRNs in tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*)**, as presented in the study referenced above.

### 🧰 What’s Included 📁

This repository provides:

🧬 **Preprocessing pipelines** for multi-omic data types:
  - ATAC-seq
  - ChIP-seq
  - DAP-seq

🔄 A modular pipeline to infer GRNs using the **GENIE3** algorithm

🌐 The **final organ-level GRN models** generated from integrating the regulatory evidence from these analyses

🧾 **The ITAG4.2-merged files Tomato annotations and fasta files updated during the preparation of the article**


Each component of this repository is designed to ensure **reproducibility**, **modularity**, and ease of use across diverse experimental setups and datasets.

### 📚 Usage & Contribution

We invite researchers to explore and adapt these pipelines for their own analyses.  
📜If you find this resource helpful, please **cite our associated publication** and feel free to open issues or pull requests for improvements and collaborations.
