# ITAG4.2-merge (Tomato) â€” GFF3 and FASTA (cDNA and protein)

This repository hosts **ITAG4.2-merge**, a merged tomato gene annotation built by combining **ITAG4.0** and **ITAG4.2beta** models from the Sol Genomics Network (SGN). It provides:
- a consolidated GFF3 annotation,
- derived transcript (cDNA) FASTA,
- derived protein FASTA.

These files are intended as Additional Supplementary Files for the associated manuscript:
-**This README (repository overview).
- **Additional Supplementary File 1 (ASF1)**: Tables from the article
- **Additional Supplementary File 2 (ASF2)**: merged GFF3 annotation.
- **Additional Supplementary File 3 (ASF3)**: cDNA FASTA derived from the merged GFF3.
- **Additional Supplementary File 4 (ASF4)**: protein FASTA derived from the merged GFF3.

> Note: ITAG4.2-merge is a community-assembled resource and is **not** an official ITAG release.
